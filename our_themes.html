		<p>The organization, led by Stephen R.  A practice that works in one case may not necessarily work in another, as parents who tried to raise a second child after the first would readily confirm.  The organization of the production process requires many factors: labor, land, technology, raw materials, energy.  It is much easier to take advantage of your position and control your child to get him to do what you want, the way you want, and do it immediately.  When our contribution is unconditional love, when we live by the basic laws of love, we encourage others to live by the basic laws of life.  This is not a "social aspirin" or "patch".  A map is simply a description of certain aspects of an area.  And he sells them at social cost.  An accurate map will have a far greater impact on our personal and interpersonal performance than any effort to change our attitudes and behavior.  Inner Orientation: You are counter-dependent and driven by the actions of your enemy.  Business risk is inevitable.  Pay attention to the sequence: ethos, pathos, logos - your character, your relationships and then the logic of your presentation. </p>

		<p>Maybe,a sense of ownership must come before the need to share.  You can also be a very busy person without being very efficient.  Among them are shareholders and potential investors, creditors, suppliers and buyers, government agencies, etc.  Increased costs would be reflected in prices and (in conditions of impoverishment of the population) would make the product uncompetitive.  This is the most consumer-friendly form of imperfect competition.  Everything is clear from the very beginning. </p>

Separation (segregation) of risks is carried out by separating assets.  Indeed, the very nature of the relationship is changing: the one to whom the leadership is delegated becomes his boss, guided by his own conscience in the direction of achieving the agreed desired results.  This is one of the greatest revelations in the field of human motivation: a satisfied need does not motivate.  Even the third generation, with its wide variety of planning tools, is primarily focused on helping people prioritize and plan their activities related to Quadrants I and III. </p>
